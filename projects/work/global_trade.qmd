## Project Notes
Our Macroeconomist was looking for a tool to analyze data on global trade and determine what goods might be most effected as future geopolitical events developed. After assessing various data sources for scope, reliability, and accessibility, I decided to pull data from the <a href="https://comtradeplus.un.org/" target="_blank">UN Comtrade Database</a>. That data was then transformed and related for presentation in the below Power BI report.
